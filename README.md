# TACO Programming Language

TACO (Three Address Code Oriented) is an experimental programming language designed as part of an engineering thesis project. The language compiles to Three Address Code (TAC) with energy consumption analysis capabilities.

## Project Overview

This project implements a compiler that:
- Takes TACO source code as input
- Generates Three Address Code (TAC) intermediate representation
- Provides energy consumption estimates for TAC instructions
- Transpiles TAC to C code for final compilation

## Goals

- Design and implement a custom programming language
- Build a compiler with lexical and syntactic analysis
- Generate Three Address Code intermediate representation
- Estimate energy consumption of program instructions
- Implement mathematical transforms (DCT, FFT) as test cases

## License

This project is developed as part of an engineering thesis under MIT License.
