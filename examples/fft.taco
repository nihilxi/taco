// Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) - Simplified Version
// Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm for power-of-2 sized arrays

// Compute FFT of size 8
// In a real implementation, this would use complex numbers
// This is a simplified demonstration for the TACO compiler

// Initialize input data
x0 = 1
x1 = 2
x2 = 3
x3 = 4
x4 = 5
x5 = 6
x6 = 7
x7 = 8

// Stage 1: Butterfly operations - First layer
t0 = x0 + x4
t1 = x1 + x5
t2 = x2 + x6
t3 = x3 + x7
t4 = x0 - x4
t5 = x1 - x5
t6 = x2 - x6
t7 = x3 - x7

// Stage 2: Butterfly operations - Second layer
s0 = t0 + t2
s1 = t1 + t3
s2 = t0 - t2
s3 = t1 - t3
s4 = t4 + t6
s5 = t5 + t7
s6 = t4 - t6

// Stage 3: Final butterfly operations - Third layer with combined result

r2 = s2 + s3
r3 = s2 - s3
r4 = s4 + s5
